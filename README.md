# ATEX_code
Hi RX,

1. Please run the test cases (which are commented) in the main.py file first. 
2. Please run the ATEX part and attack evaluation to get familar with the codes.
3. Most importantly, add print() function wherever you want to get intermediate outputs, to get familar with the codes.
